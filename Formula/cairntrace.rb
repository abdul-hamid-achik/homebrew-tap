# Source-build formula for cairntrace (Bun/TypeScript). Unlike the Go-based
# taps here, cairntrace bundles Playwright, which does not `bun build --compile`
# to a standalone binary cleanly, so we install from the tag source tarball and
# `bun install` at build time. A runtime browser is installed on demand (caveat).

  def install
    # Install JS deps in the extracted source, then move the whole tree (incl.
    # node_modules) into libexec so the `bin/cairn` wrapper's
    # `import "../src/cli/index.ts"` resolves (libexec/bin/cairn -> libexec/src).

    <<~EOS
      cairntrace runs browser specs via Playwright. Install Chromium once:
        bunx playwright install chromium
      (or `bunx playwright install --with-deps chromium` on Linux).
