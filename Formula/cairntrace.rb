# Source-build formula for cairntrace (Bun/TypeScript). Unlike the Go-based
# taps here, cairntrace bundles Playwright, which does not `bun build --compile`
# to a standalone binary cleanly, so we install from the tag source tarball and
# `bun install` at build time. A runtime browser is installed on demand (caveat).

    <<~EOS
      cairntrace is a Bun shebang CLI (this formula depends on bun).

      Default backend:
        brew install vercel-labs/agent-browser/agent-browser

      Optional Playwright backend:
        bunx playwright install chromium
      (or `bunx playwright install --with-deps chromium` on Linux).
